# credit-risk-classification
This is my credit-risk-classification challenge and I am happy to submit not for the grades but I am learning new things. This work has been a bit challenging but I am glad to make an effort. With the help of ChatGPT, google, and my classmates and not ignoringing the guidance of my Instructor and TA, I was able to get this  challenge completed.
